                        The Revolution Software Development Club at Vishwakarma University was deep-rooted
                        on 20th June, 2020 with the idea to open up a separate workspace for the students to
                        explore different technologies to get established and lay the grounds for the improvisation
                        leading to tomorrow’s Industries.
                        The club aims to improve the quality of learning and lead every individual to adapt to
                        different work spaces. The organization keeps the track of every aspect of qualitative
                        learning which helps the club to imbibe more and more insights on an individual’s overall
                        development. The Revolution Software Development Club (RSDC) focuses more on
                        practical approach rather than focusing on the theoretical parts of certain modules. An
                        individual will be tested upon how he/she can use their skill set to tackle a particular
                        problem and provide an optimized solution, being the ultimate goal as to make the most
                        effective use of the situations or the provided resources.
